#The Code Done Broke!

And it's your job to fix it.

This is a coding exercise I use when I interview candidates for potential frontend development roles at Cond√© Nast. It you were smart enough to look up my GitHub profile before your interview and found this repo, I like you already.

###Requirements

Try to make index.html look like the picture below in a browser:

* 7x7 grid of 75x75px boxes alternating red and blue
* The grid should be centered in the browser window
* When a user mousesover a square it should turn yellow; when they mouseout it should return to its initial color
* When a user clicks on a square the browser should popup the position of the current square counting from left to right top to bottom

There is some starter HTML, CSS and JavaScript code written out for you to give you a head start. Be warned: The code done broke! You can use all, some or none of the starter code. Feel free it completely rewrite it. The only criteria is that the page looks and functions as described. 

As a convenience, index.html has jQuery and normalize.css loaded for you.

###Tips

* Feel free to Google around during this exercise
* You can also ask me questions, just not directly if something is the right answer
* Keep your inspector open. It's hard to debug done broke code a text editor
