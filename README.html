<p>Can you help us fix it?</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>Try to make index.html look like the picture below in a browser:</p>
<ul>
<li>7x7 grid of 75x75px boxes alternating red and blue</li>
<li>The grid should be centered in the browser window</li>
<li>When a user mousesover a square it should turn yellow; when they mouseout it should return to its initial color</li>
<li>When a user clicks on a square the browser should popup the position of the current square counting from left to right top to bottom</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Feel free to Google around during this exercise</li>
<li>You can also ask us questions, just not directly if something is the right answer</li>
<li>Keep your inspector open. It&#39;s easier to debug broken code that way :)</li>
</ul>
